The year 2016 has been bad enough for most of us, but today just adds insult to injury. At roughly 7PM, video-game icon *Hideo Kojima* has been found to be following exactly 69 people over his personal English Twitter account.

For many people, especially long-time fans of his works, this is a massive shock. "At first, I didn't want to believe my eyes. But I had to admit it. There it was, and nothing can change it.", Twitter user boocanan, who first found this occurence, says.

CNN Europe has contacted Kojima himself, but has not yet gotten a reply. Neither has Kojima tweeted on the offending account since he has been found out. It is unclear what will happen after this monumental tragedy which left many people in shock and horror.
