Last weekend, CNN Europe investigated on what seemed to be a normal family living a normal life. The Jäger family lives a peaceful life in rural Germany, near Frankfurt. Consisting of Anne and Michael with their 13 and 12 year old children, Benno and Anja, plus their youngest child Isabella, they live in a normal-sized house in a normal-sized city. Nothing out of the ordinary, one would think. That is, until CNN Europe uncovered this family's dark secret.

The signs first showed when a Twitter user named [DamienSergal](http://twitter.com/damiensergal) boasted about how they were too young to even "yiff" online. Most people disregarded this post as mere conjecture, however, a user who wishes to remain anonymous contacted CNN Europe with this information. We immediately dispatched an investigation team to check Damien's "Second Life" (a virtual game where you can completely customize your avatar) account. When engaging with the user online, they challenged us to "fight them IRL" and willingly provided us with their contact details.

When arriving at the Jäger household, CNN Europe found that none of the two pubescent children had anything to do with operating DamienSergal. The parents, too, denied any allegations. Just when the investigation was about to end, a "body pillow" (a life-size pillow depicting a character in a sexual way)  was found in the 4-year old Isabella's closet. She then confessed to operating the online accounts and told us that although she was barely able to form a coherent sentence, she had created a "sergal fursona" for use in online Role Playing. A fursona is an anthropomorphic character that resembles an animal species, mostly cats or dogs. A sergal is a fictional race used as "fursona" by a large amount of people.

The legality of possessing a fursona at such a young age is currently being discussed by a team of in-house CNN Europe lawyers. As Germany is a very "furry"-friendly country, however, it is likely that young Isabella and her family won't incur any serious charges.
