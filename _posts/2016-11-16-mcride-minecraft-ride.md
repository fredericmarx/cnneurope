In an exclusive interview, the rapper and frontman of the popular group Death Grips finally reveals the intention behind his moniker.

"I've just had enough of the speculation," he told CNN. "I came up with this alias when I was 18. Minecraft was a big part of my life back then."

Minecraft is a video game where the player's objective is to let their creativity run free. "I loved it. Heck, I still do. I play with my friends online at least once a week."

When asked why he decided to reveal the secret, he said: "Frankly, I don't care much anymore. Everyone knows Minecraft. So I believe that everyone will come to terms with the fact that the MC stands for Minecraft."

He also announced that his group will be naming their next tour the "Minecraft Tour".
"People need to grow up and realize that adults can enjoy games meant for kids too."
