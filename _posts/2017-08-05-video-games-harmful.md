On Saturday, the 05th of April 2017, scientists have published that they have found conclusive evidence that video games positively contribute to the downfall of society as a whole.  The investigative team has stated that 'gamers' are creating a schism in popular culture.

A mix of sociologists and behavioral scientists have led an investigation on the correlation between popular culture and the slow, but steady downfall of human society. They have found out that the so-called 'gamer culture' is a significant factor in many factors which contribute to said downfall. The culture often leans on the dehumanization and harrassment of individuals and minorities, moreso than any other part of popular culture. Many people therefore refuse to associate with it.

Apart from other statements, the article also criticizes how 'gamers' are quick to take things of context. Among the examples cited is an article with a title that might be considered offensive to this specific group, but actually provided in-depth analysis of the topic in question. Nevertheless, it was widely rejected by this exact 'gamer' subculture.
