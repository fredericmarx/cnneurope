On Saturday, the 28th of October, 2017, paramedics stationed in Whitehorse, the capital of Canada's Yukon Territory, recieved a strange distress signal coming from the middle of the wilderness. When they decided to send out a squad to check on the signal, they found a young man, completely lost and distraught, carrying two unloaded guns. This man is known as Nagito Komaeda, and is a famed high school student well known for his extraordinary luck. Komaeda was presumed to have died after being involved in a fatal accident in an abandoned factory last year.

Scott Rhindley, one of the paramedics who first found Komaeda, says that he was "babbling something incoherent about hope defeating despair". "When we found him, he approached us and asked us if we'd seen a person called Hajime Hinata. No idea who that is", Rhindley reports. CNN Europen is currently investigating the identity of Hinata, and will update this article accordingly.

Komaeda has been delivered to a hospital, and doctors are reporting that his condition is stable, and that he will likely be completely healed by the beginning of next week.
