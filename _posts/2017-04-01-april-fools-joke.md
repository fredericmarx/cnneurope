Can you believe that it's already April 1st? I couldn't, and now I'm all out of ideas for funny April Fools' jokes. This sucks. My chef is expecting me to come up with something original and funny, but I just can't come up with anything! Why is originality and creativity so hard? How do all the other sites do it? I don't think I'll be able to keep my job here, so I might as well publish this. Fuck you, boss.
