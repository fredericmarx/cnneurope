Approximately one hour ago, a conflict between two Twitter users broke out. User [@syrup_0](http://twitter.com/syrup_0) had created a online image saying "I LOVE EATING PUSSY".  He had started a campaign to spread his message. In reponse, user [@pennysucks](http://twitter.com/pennysucks) created a modified version of this image, now saying "I LOVE NOT BEING HORNY". This quickly escalated into a full-scale war, with both sides trying to recruit new members for their respective cause.

Now, the conflict it beginning to leak into real life. Police reports state that in multiple big cities around the world, including New York, Berlin and Singapore, protesters wielding flags and banners saying "HORNY FOREVER" have been spotted. Conversely, an anonymous source has told CNN Europe that violent protesters exclaiming "FOR THE ABOLISHMENT OF HORNY!" while smashing windows of various erotic stores and establishments. It is currently unknown who these protesters are or where they come from, but it is very clear that the online incident between the two Twitter users caused all of this.

CNN Europe will update this article as soon as new information comes to light.
